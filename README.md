## Update procedures:

- Prototype development files will have `_proto#` appended to the end of the file name
- Changes will be committed to the repository by selecting `create a new branch` and then performing a `pull request` to merge the newly updated content
- Updates or pull requests should be named or have comments identifying what has been updated or changed
- Any repository path structure changes should be communicated to all individuals who directly update the repository
- Relative links should not be used on any pages and all links in the repository should be absolute links
- Create and name all files in the locations that reflects what they will be named and where they will be eventually be published when created on Canada.ca
- Follow [Government of Canada domains and URLs - How to write URLs](https://design.canada.ca/specifications/mandatory-elements/domains-urls.html#du3a) guidelines for naming paths and files
- In the [_config.yml](https://github.com/cra-design/gst-hst-business/blob/main/_config.yml) file the `developerOptions:` setting should be changed to `false` before testing takes place

## Design phase roadmap:

- [x] Prototype: co-design navigation and content
- [x] SME review and accuracy check
- [x] Validation usability testing (including accessibility review)
- [ ] Refine prototype (if required)
- [ ] ~~Spot check usability (if required)~~
