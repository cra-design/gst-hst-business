<h2 id="toc_1">Who needs to file a GST/HST return</h2>
<p>If you are registered for GST/HST, you <strong>must file a GST/HST return for each reporting period</strong>.</p>
<h3>Filing if you had no business activity</h3>
<p>You must file a return for each reporting period <strong>even if</strong> you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have no business transactions or income</li>
  <li>Have no net tax to remit</li>
  <li>Are <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/account-close.html">closing a GST/HST account</a> (you need to file a final return)</li>
</ul>
<p>Filing a GST/HST return without anything to report is referred to as filing a nil return. You can see your filing due dates and reporting periods in your CRA account.</p>
<h2 id="toc_2">Filing and payment deadlines</h2>
<p>The due date of your return is determined by your reporting period. You can see your filing due dates and reporting periods in your CRA account.</p>
<p>We assign default reporting periods based on revenue amounts. However, you may be able to <strong>change your reporting period</strong> if you want to file a return more frequently. You can change your reporting period by signing into your CRA account (My Business Account or Represent a Client).</p>

<h3>Due dates for filing your return</h3>
<p>If you are eligible to file paper returns, the personalized GST/HST return <span class="nowrap">(Form GST34-2)</span> you receive will show the due date at the top of the form.</p>
<p>If your due date is a <strong>Saturday</strong>, <strong>Sunday</strong> or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/public-holidays.html">public holiday recognized by the CRA</a>, your return or payment is on time if we receive it on the <strong>next business day</strong>.</p>
<p>We can charge <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/file-gst-hst-return/reporting-requirements-deadlines/gst-hst-filing-penalties.html">penalties and interest</a> on returns or amounts we have not received by the due date.</p>
<h3>Monthly and quarterly reporting periods</h3>
<p>If your reporting period is monthly or quarterly, your filing and payment deadline is <strong>1 month after the end of the reporting period</strong>.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Example deadlines for monthly and quarterly filers</summary>
  <p>If the end of a monthly reporting period is <strong>July 31</strong>, your payment deadline and filing deadline would be <strong>August 31</strong>.</p>
  <p>If the end of a quarterly reporting period is <strong>March 31</strong>, the payment deadline and filing deadline would be <strong>April 30</strong>.</p>
