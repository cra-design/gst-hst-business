  <h2 id="toc0">When to expect your refund</h2>
  <p>You can claim a refund if your net tax (<strong><span class="nowrap">line 109</span></strong> of your GST/HST return) for a reporting period is a negative amount.</p>
  <p>Generally, the CRA process a GST/HST return in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2 weeks</strong> if you filed electronically</li>
    <li><strong>4 weeks</strong> if you filed a paper return</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you did <strong>not</strong> include all the necessary information but completed your return correctly, the processing of your refund could be delayed.</p>
  <p>The CRA will hold any GST/HST refund or rebate you are entitled to until all outstanding returns and amounts are received. This includes all amounts payable and returns required under other programs administered by the CRA. The CRA can also use any GST/HST refund or rebate that you are entitled to receive to pay that outstanding amount.</p>
  <p>You may receive your refund deposited directly into your bank account. For more information on how to enroll for direct deposit, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">Direct deposit – Canada Revenue Agency</a>.</p>
  <p>The CRA pay refund interest according to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">prescribed interest rate</a>. Refund interest is compounded daily on an overpayment up to and including the day the overpayment is refunded, repaid, or applied. The calculation of interest we pay <strong><sup></sup>ends </strong>on the day the refund is paid or applied.</p>
  <p>For more information, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/file-return/reporting-requirements-deadlines/penalties-gst-hst-returns.html">GST/HST – Penalties and interest</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="toc1">Penalties and interest</h2>
  <p>Failing to comply with your GST/HST obligations could lead to penalties, interest, or even prosecution.</p>
  <p>For example, penalties or interests may apply if you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>did not file on time</li>
    <li>received a demand to file and did not file</li>
    <li>had to file electronically and did not</li>
    <li>made a false statement or omission</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Interest is charged if you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>have an overdue balance owing on a return</li>
    <li>make a late or insufficient instalment payment</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For more information, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/file-return/reporting-requirements-deadlines/penalties-gst-hst-returns.html">GST/HST – Penalties and interest</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="chngrtrn">Change a return</h2>
  <p>To change a return you have already sent, do <strong>not </strong>file another return. Instead, go to :</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">My Business Account</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">Represent a Client</a></li>
  </ul>
  <div>You can also send a letter to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">tax centre</a> indicating your GST/HST business number, the GST/HST reporting period to be amended and the corrected amounts per line number on your GST/HST return. Make sure the letter is signed by the owner, or an authorized representative for whom the CRA have the correct level of authorization and includes the name and telephone number of a person the CRA can contact if needed.</div>
  <h2 id="toc3">Make a voluntary disclosure</h2>
  <p>The Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP) allows you to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>fix inaccurate or incomplete information</li>
    <li>disclose information you had not previously reported to us</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may apply to the VDP to avoid penalties and prosecution. If you are eligible, you will only have to pay the taxes owing and interest.</p>
  <p>For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/voluntary-disclosures-program-overview.html">Voluntary Disclosures Program</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="toc4">Support for small businesses</h2>
  <p>The Liaison Officer Service is designed to help small businesses understand their tax obligations. Selected small and medium-sized businesses can <strong>voluntarily </strong>choose to participate in the program. If you participate, a liaison officer will help you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>understand your tax obligations</li>
    <li>find out where you can get more information</li>
    <li>learn the common mistakes businesses make</li>
    <li>get answers to your questions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/liaison-officer-initiative-loi.html">Liaison Officer service</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="toc5">Prepare for a GST/HST post-assessment review</h2>
  <p>To make sure you reported certain amounts correctly on your GST/HST return, CRA may contact you for a GST/HST post-assessment review. This is not a GST/HST audit.</p>
  <p>During this review, the CRA will ask you to provide a brief explanation to validate the amounts on your GST/HST return. In some cases, you may be asked to provide supporting documents for these amounts such as receipts or a bill of sale. Adjustments may be made to your GST/HST return, if required.</p>
  <p>There are some common adjustments that are made to correct reporting errors on GST/HST returns. Read about <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/complete-file-return-business/file-return.html#toc4">common mistakes to avoid when completing your GST/HST return</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="toc6">Prepare for a GST/HST audit</h2>
  <p>Being audited can be overwhelming. The following questions will help you prepare for a GST/HST audit and understand how the CRA’s tax audit process works:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Why do we audit and what is a tax audit?</li>
    <li>What are your responsibilities and what happens during an audit?</li>
    <li>What are your rights?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For more information on these subjects, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/changes-your-business/business-audits.html">Business audits</a>.</p>

  <h2>View a previously filed GST/HST return</h2>
  <p>You may view the status and the details of a previously filed GST/HST return using <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">My Business Account</a>. You will also be able to view upcoming and overdue GST/HST returns by using the same digital service.</p>
  <h2>Changing a return already filed</h2>
  <p>Returns can only be adjusted electronically using the My Business Account (MyBA) portal. If you do not already have a MyBA user ID and password, you can create one at <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">My Business Account</a>.</p>
  <p>If you are not registered with MyBA, send your adjustment request, in writing, to your tax centre.</p>
  <h2 id="rtn_dcmnts">Retaining supporting documents</h2>
  <p>You do not have to send receipts or supporting documents when you file your GST/HST information electronically. However, keep all supporting documents for six years, as the CRA may contact you for more information after they process your return.</p>
  <p>You should also keep a working copy of your return for your records. It, and any other information you use to prepare your return, are subject to audit and must be retained for verification purposes.</p>
