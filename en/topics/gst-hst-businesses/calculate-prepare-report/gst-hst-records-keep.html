    <p>You do not have to send receipts or supporting documents when you file your GST/HST information electronically. However, you must keep your records in case we ask to see them.</p>
    <h2>Which records to keep</h2>
    <p>You must keep certain records to support your GST/HST returns and claims. These records include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sales and purchase invoices</li>
      <li>All other records related to your business operations and the GST/HST</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you file electronically, you should also keep your working copies of returns.</p>
    <p>You need the correct information on the invoices you get from your suppliers to support your input tax credit (ITC) claims.</p>
    <p>Refer to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/15-1.html">GST/HST Memorandum 15.1, General Requirements for Books and Records</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/complete-file-input-tax-credit.html#dcmts_rqrd">Records you need to support your ITC claim</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How long to keep your records</h2>
    <p>Usually, you must keep your records for <strong>6 years</strong> from the end of the year to which they relate.</p>
    <p>However, we may ask you to keep the invoices longer than 6 years. If you want to destroy your records earlier, you must send a written request to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">nearest tax services office</a> and wait for approval.</p>
    <p>Refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/15-1/general-requirements-books-records-revised-june-2005.html#P119_16593">Permission for prior disposal of records</a></p>
