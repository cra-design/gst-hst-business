<h2 id="linebyline">Line-by-line instructions</h2>
<p>Before you begin, make sure you are completing the correct GST/HST return, and have chosen the filing method that works best for you. Most GST/HST registrants are <strong>required to file electronically</strong>.</p>
<p>Refer to:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/file-gst-hst-return/how-file.html">How to file a GST/HST return</a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="bussinfo">Your business information</h3>
<p>If you are completing a GST/HST return <strong>in your CRA account</strong>, some of your business information is pre-populated.</p>
<p>If you are completing a personalized GST/HST return on paper <span class="nowrap">(Form GST34-2),</span> your business information is pre-printed.</p>
<p>If you are completing a non-personalized GST/HST return on paper (GST62), enter:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Business number</li>
  <li>Company name</li>
  <li>Reporting period</li>
  <li>Due date for the GST/HST return</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view your reporting period and due dates of expected returns in your online <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA account</a>.</p>
<h4>Builders of new or substantially-renovated housing</h4>
<p>Certain builders must file their GST/HST returns using GST/HST NETFILE only. Other builders may have to file their GST/HST returns using another electronic method.</p>
<p>To find out which method you must use, refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/gi-099.html">GST/HST Info Sheet <span class="nowrap">GI-099</span>, Builders and Electronic Filing Requirements</a>.</p>
<p>If you must use GST/HST NETFILE only, do not follow the instructions on this page to complete your return. Instead, follow the instructions in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/gi-118.html">GST/HST Info Sheet GI-118, Builders and GST/HST NETFILE</a>.</p>
<h3 id="totalsales">Total sales and other revenues (line 101)</h3>
<p>You are liable for the GST/HST you charge on property or services on the day you receive payment or the day the payment is due, whichever is earlier. We usually consider a payment to be due on the date you issue an invoice or the date specified in an agreement, whichever comes first.</p>

          <p>Occasionally, you may make a credit sale that becomes uncollectible and you write off the uncollectible amount in your records as a bad debt.</p>
          <p>If the bad debt is part of an amount that you have already included on your GST/HST return and you remitted that amount, you can recover the GST/HST as a tax <strong>adjustment</strong> on <span class="nowrap">line 107</span> (or line 108 if you are filing using GST/HST TELEFILE). You have to make the tax adjustment in a reporting period that is <strong>within 4 years </strong>of the reporting period in which you wrote off the bad debt in your records. <strong>Do not </strong>adjust the return in which you originally reported the GST/HST on the sale.</p>
          <p>The debt has to be written off as a bad debt in your records, and you have to deal with the person at arm's length.</p>
          <p>Use the following formula to calculate the tax adjustment:</p>
          <p><strong>A × (B ÷ C)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A</strong> is the GST/HST payable on the sale.</p>
          <p><strong>B</strong> is the total unpaid amount that was written off as a bad debt, including GST/HST and applicable provincial sales taxes (PST).</p>
          <p><strong>C</strong> is the total amount of the sale, including GST/HST and applicable PST.</p>
