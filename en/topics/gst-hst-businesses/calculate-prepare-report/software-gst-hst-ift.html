    <h2 id="h_1">How it works</h2>
    <p>GST/HST Internet File Transfer has been designed to accept a specific file format (<code>.tax</code> extension), and the CRA-certified software will include instructions on how to save your return in that format.</p>
    <h2 id="h_2">Certified software</h2>
    <p>Certified tax preparation software means that the developer of the software package has gone through a process with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to establish that the particular package is compatible with the CRA systems. This does not mean that we endorse or recommend any one product over any other.</p>
    <p>The following table contains the list of software certified for use with GST/HST Internet File Transfer. We will update this list as new software products are certified. Please note that inclusion in this list is not an endorsement of the software products by the CRA.</p>
