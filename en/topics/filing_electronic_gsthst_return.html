<h2 id="h_3">Browser requirements</h2>
<p>To make sure you can file securely and confidentially, you must use a Web browser that supports the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. If you don't have a browser that meets the security standard, you can either download a complete browser package or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/access-online-services-safely.html#h4">upgrade to TLS 1.2</a>.</p>
<h3>Browser settings</h3>
<p>You must <strong>enable cookies and JavaScript</strong> in your browser settings.</p>

<h2 id="h_4">Security, privacy, and non-responsibility</h2>
<h3 id="scrty">Security and confidentiality</h3>
<p>The CRA limits access to browsers supporting Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is a protocol that provides authentication, confidentially, and data integrity between communicating applications. Using the appropriate safeguards and configuration, TLS provides a method of transmitting data securely across networks. Effective implementation of TLS will assist in mitigating the most serious threats with web-based applications such as eavesdropping, data tampering, and message forgery. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/access-online-services-safely.html#h4">Upgrade to TLS 1.2</a> so that your system is as secure as possible.</p>
<p>The CRA uses advanced encryption technology and security protocols to protect your personal information. However, while we have made every possible effort to ensure the safety and integrity of transactions at our Web site, the Internet is a public network and therefore is outside our control.</p>
<h3 id="prvcy">Privacy notice statement</h3>
<p>Personal information is collected under the authority of the Excise Tax Act (ETA) and/or Québec Sales Tax Act (QSTA) for the purpose of filing your goods and services tax/ harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) and/or Québec sales tax (QST) returns and claiming eligible rebates. Please note that the Internet Protocol (IP) address will be collected, stored and used to identify the general location from where a return/rebate was filed from, to identify anomalies or inconsistencies that may warrant further review.</p>
<p>Information may also be used for the administration and enforcement of the ETA and/or QSTA and may be shared or verified with other government institutions as permitted by law. Incomplete or inaccurate information may result in the delay or denial of refunds and/or rebates; penalties may also apply.</p>
<p>Information is described in personal information bank PPU 241 in the CRA chapter of Information about Programs and Information Holdings (formerly Info Source). Personal information is protected under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/index.html">Privacy Act</a> and individuals have a right of protection, access to and correction or notation of their personal information.
